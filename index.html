						Hi Katherine, check out this site! I'm not starting a business - just got the domain for fun. Will probably put some blog style content on here.

				<p>I've been preparing to start using OpenGL this evening! This will be my first time coding for a GPU. I intend to feed in position and orientation coordinates of an observer, and transform my trusty red square.
					I've just put in some JS to use the WASD keys to capture observer position, now to create the transformation matrices and use them.
					</p>
					<p>...</p>
					<p>
						At long last I have movement of my square!
						It looks like 2 spinning squares rather than a cube, as I haven't meshed the cube properly; I've specified 8 vertices, and the shader has only drawn triangles between some of them.
					</p>
					<p>
						
						As promised, the GPU has a wealth of linear algebra methods. Unfortunately, the linear algera used to find the observer's transformation matrix, that occurs once per frame, needs to run on the CPU, and therefore needs to be coded up in JS (eugh).
